We say that a string 's' is an anagram of another string 't' if the
letters in 's' can be rearranged to form 't'.

For example, "butterfly" is an anagram of "flutterby", since a
rearrangement of the first word results in the second.

We say that a position 'i' in 's' and 't' match, if 's' is an anagram of
't', and s[i]==t[i].

In this question, you will be given two words, 's' and 't'. You have
to output the number of matching positions if s is an anagram of t,
and -1 if s is not an anagram of t.

Input
-----
The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the first
string, with length <= 100 characters. The second line contains the
second string, with length <= 100 characters.

Output
------
If the first string is an anagram of the second string, then output
the number of matching positions. Otherwise, print -1.
