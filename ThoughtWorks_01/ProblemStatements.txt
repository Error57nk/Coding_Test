Soumika has a string S and its starting index is 1. 
The string S consists of characters from . 
As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay 
Tendulkar. She asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number
 of even numbered characters ( i.e  ) for every index i . 
For an index i, the result should be calculated from i to the end of 
the string. As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help 
him find the solution.

Input:
First line contains a string S.

Output:
Print |S| space-separated integers,the result of every index.




Given string S is .
for index 1
Number of even numbers from 5 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 1 is 7.
for index 2
Number of even numbers from 7 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 2 is 7.
for index 3
Number of even numbers from 4 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 3 is 7.
for index 3
Number of even numbers from 6 to end of the string is 6 so the result of index 4 is 6.....
